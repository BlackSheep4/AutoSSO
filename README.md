# Google AutoSSO
Google Auto Single Sign On (Google AutoSSO) is a tool coded in Python that automatize the fusion of the local user of a Windows system and GCPW Google tool.

## Practical Case
As a company, you can use Google SSO by installing GCPW on workers' computers to create easy access and management of enterprise devices. With GCPW, users can work in a local user session created by this Google tool. The problem is that many users will still use the local Windows user device (not the local Google user).

To avoid this, this tool brings the local user together with the google user, making a merge WITHOUT DELETING ANY LOCAL WINDOWS USER FILES.

(See GCPW for more information: https://support.google.com/a/answer/9250996?hl=en).
